[00:01.80]Shontelle - Impossible
[00:10.80]I remember years ago
[00:14.00]Someone told me I should take
[00:16.20]Caution when it comes to love
[00:18.91]I did, I did
[00:21.36]And you were strong and I was not
[00:24.01]My illusion, my mistake
[00:26.71]I was careless, I forgot
[00:29.34]I did
[00:31.69]And now when all is done
[00:34.09]There is nothing to say
[00:35.49]You have gone and so effortlessly
[00:37.09]You have won
[00:39.70]You can go ahead tell them
[00:41.65]Tell them all I know now
[00:43.95]Shout it from the roof top
[00:46.61]Write it on the sky love
[00:49.31]All we had is gone now
[00:52.01]Tell them I was happy
[00:54.37]And my heart is broken
[00:57.86]All my scars are open
[00:59.91]Tell them what I hoped would be
[01:03.06]Impossible, impossible
[01:08.27]Impossible, impossible
[01:14.73]Falling out of love is hard
[01:17.33]Falling for betrayal is worst
[01:20.00]Broken trust and broken hearts
[01:22.45]I know, I know
[01:25.40]Thinking all you need is there
[01:27.96]Building faith on love is worst
[01:30.71]Empty promises will wear
[01:33.31]I know (I know)
[01:36.51]And now when all is gone
[01:38.16]There is nothing to say
[01:39.71]And if you're done with embarrassing me
[01:42.02]On your own you can go ahead tell them
[01:45.25]Tell them all I know now
[01:48.05]Shout it from the roof top
[01:50.70]Write it on the sky love
[01:53.41]All we had is gone now
[01:56.11]Tell them I was happy
[01:58.71]And my heart is broken
[02:01.37]All my scars are open
[02:03.95]Tell them what I hoped would be
[02:07.40]Impossible, impossible
[02:12.31]Impossible, impossible
[02:17.76]Impossible, impossible
[02:23.07]Impossible, impossible
[02:29.37]Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)
[02:40.07]I remember years ago
[02:42.53]Someone told me I should take
[02:45.43]Caution when it comes to love
[02:48.01]I did
[02:49.81]Tell them all I know now
[02:52.11]Shout it from the roof top
[02:54.73]Write it on the sky love
[02:57.34]All we had is gone now
[03:00.09]Tell them I was happy(I was happy)
[03:03.30]And my heart is broken
[03:05.45]All my scars are open
[03:07.81]Tell them what I hoped would be
[03:11.21]Impossible, impossible
[03:16.36]Impossible, impossible
[03:21.71]Impossible, impossible
[03:27.01]Impossible, impossible
[03:32.89]I remember years ago
[03:35.71]Someone told me I should take
[03:38.71]Caution when it comes to love
[03:41.47]I did
[03:43.07]THE END
